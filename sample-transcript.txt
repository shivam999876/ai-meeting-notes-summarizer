Meeting: Weekly Team Standup
Date: December 15, 2024
Duration: 45 minutes
Participants: John (Team Lead), Sarah (Developer), Mike (Designer), Lisa (QA)

John: Good morning everyone, let's start our weekly standup. Sarah, what did you work on last week?

Sarah: Hi team! Last week I completed the user authentication module and started working on the dashboard API endpoints. I ran into some issues with the JWT token validation, but I was able to resolve them by updating the middleware. I also completed the unit tests for the auth module.

John: Great work Sarah. Any blockers or challenges?

Sarah: Not really, everything is progressing well. I should have the dashboard endpoints ready by Wednesday.

John: Excellent. Mike, how about you?

Mike: Last week I finished the new UI design for the customer portal. I've been working closely with Sarah to ensure the design aligns with the API structure. I also started working on the mobile responsive design for the dashboard. The main challenge was getting the layout to work well on smaller screens, but I think I've found a good solution.

John: How's the timeline looking for the mobile design?

Mike: I'm about 70% done. Should be complete by Friday, then I can move on to the admin panel redesign.

John: Perfect. Lisa, what's your status?

Lisa: I've been testing the authentication module that Sarah built. So far, everything looks good - I've tested various scenarios including invalid credentials, expired tokens, and edge cases. I found a minor issue with the password reset flow, but Sarah already fixed it. I also started creating test cases for the dashboard features.

John: Any critical bugs or issues we need to address?

Lisa: Nothing critical. The password reset issue was minor and already resolved. I'll continue testing the dashboard features as they become available.

John: Good. Now let's talk about this week's priorities. We have the client demo on Friday, so we need to make sure the customer portal is fully functional. Sarah, can you prioritize the dashboard completion?

Sarah: Absolutely. I'll focus on getting the dashboard endpoints done by Wednesday so Lisa can test them thoroughly before the demo.

John: Perfect. Mike, can you ensure the mobile design is complete by Wednesday as well?

Mike: Yes, I'll prioritize that. I can work on the admin panel redesign next week.

John: Great. Lisa, please coordinate with Sarah and Mike to ensure everything is tested before Friday's demo.

Lisa: Will do. I'll create a testing checklist and make sure we cover all the critical user flows.

John: Excellent. Any other business or questions?

Sarah: I have a question about the API rate limiting. Should we implement that now or wait until after the demo?

John: Good question. Let's implement basic rate limiting this week. It's important for production readiness. Sarah, can you add that to your tasks?

Sarah: Sure, I'll add rate limiting to the authentication endpoints. Shouldn't take more than a few hours.

John: Perfect. Any other questions? No? Alright, let's wrap up. Remember, the demo is on Friday at 2 PM. Let's make sure everything is polished and working smoothly. Thanks everyone, have a great week!

Sarah: Thanks John, you too!
Mike: See you all later!
Lisa: Bye team!
